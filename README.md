# Byron Mansfield's Github Pages Blog

## Welcome
Welcome to my github-pages blog. You can view it [here](https://byronmansfield.github.io/personal-blog/).Have a look around at some of my other repos. Maybe my dotfiles, or my vim setup.

Hopefully you find something you like, and you will follow me or star one of my
repos.

## Looking for Golang Projects to contribute to

I am currently learning Go and really enjoying it. I am trying to write as many of my new projects in it as possible. I find after learning a language you never really truly learn it until you work on a real project with real problems. Since we are not currently using it at my job, that has left me looking for open source projects written in Go that have room for a new-ish Go developer to start writing some real Go code. If you have any suggestions or a project of your own that you need any help with, please feel free to run it by me.
