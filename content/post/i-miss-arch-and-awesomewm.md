I really miss my Arch plus AwesomeWM setup. I was able to tailor it to my every desire. And it was everything I dreamed. I basically lived in a terminal session and had all the cli version of apps. It was amazing!

With that said, in trying to make my mac laptop more like "home" there are some things I was happy to fine that helped satisfy my desire for more cli, linux like environment on a mac. These are just my opinions, and I certainly do not know everything. So if you are someone who likes similar things that I do and know of more tips and tricks that may be better, please by all means share you awesome linux knowledge to share with all.

First of all I need to clarify for any readers that are just like "Oh, well just switch to linux". Yes, I know. I feel you. I would probably say the same thing while reading this. And typically I probably would. But I know me, and when faced with just having to get shit done sometimes and not have to fool around with too many Linux shinanogans, I can get irratated sometimes rather quickly, as well as trying to get more in touch with real life than just my computer. I need something that is just easy and reliable, and just fucking works, but yet has the flexibility to handle almost anything, and has awesome support in case anything blows up. Thus, I settled for a 2lb mac laptop. Sigh...... Now back to the "lets make this feel more like linux" part.

# iTerm2

For a while, I tried Mac's default terminal. Meh. I also really tried to get urxvt working on OS X. I can, it was just a lot of work, and still have much more kinks to work out. Sigh. iTerm2 is a happy medium. I can view images inside of it, I can customize it realitively easily; zsh works great in it, awesome font support, has native tmux support.

# Package Manager

Oooohhhh ports and brew. How I hate thee. I really want a true package manager for mac. This is definatly a missing piece for mac's. No offical package manager for the OS. Pacman is amazing. Aptitude is great. Yum too. WTF ports. Brew, your the lesser of the two evils, but I mean come on bro. WTF is up with all the Celler symlinks and shit! kladd made an awesome git repo for how to do this on Yosemite, but I'm super nervious being on El Capitan (since it's got different user permissions) that I'm going to fuck shit up. Sounds awesome, but I've been down this path before, where reality is it just fucked up your shit to where you can barely use it.

Byron please finish this later. It probably has many typos and still needs editing.
