In the past day and a half, I've gotten a lot of things done. Mostly nerdy type tasks, but some useful and productive ones as well. I have this free time because of the Thanksgiving break. But in the near future I will have tons of freetime. Well sort of. Free in the sense that no one is forcing me to do anything in particular. However it would be wise to use the time wisely and constructively.

#### What I've done

- Spent some time learning how to play the piano
- Relaxed
- Learned a little bit more about Logic Pro and some tips and tricks on how to make some songs. (Really good tips too, saved me a ton of time. Plus found some new really amazing YouTube channels)
- Completely redid my tmux and vim configs
- Got more familiarized with setting up this github pages project with hugo
- Of course spent some time cooking and eating for T-Day
- Listed and sold things through selling apps

#### Whew

I feel pretty good about it. Some of the time was just catching up on things that I have been really wanting to do. Other things were pretty productive. If not beneficial now, I'm confident that I will find it very beneficial later down the road.
