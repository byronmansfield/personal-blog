So we are now out of our apartment and staying at a temporary house while we sell off what is left of our belongings. We've managed to sell all of our furniture, most of the major kitchen things. The only things left are my girlfriends shoes, clothes, and some dust collectors. So it's not like we have to sell any of those things, but the extra money wouldn't hurt.

Since leaving my full time job, I've shifted much of my focus to any research and prep for our upcoming travels, and other ways we can make income on the road. Don't get me wrong, I've certainly done some useless surfing of the web, endless scrolling through the book face and what not. But I think I've made pretty good progress fleshing out some of our plans.

Up until now it's been the distant fantasy that we will be half way around the world exploring new and exciting places. But things are getting pretty real, pretty quick. Before I know it we will be buying a ticket for our amtrak trip. I'm getting really excited.
