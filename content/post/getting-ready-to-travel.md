So today is Thanksgiving Day. I am now back at my nearly empty house with realizations of our new life ahead. As we wind down our currently lives and gear up for our new ones, you start to notice different things. So I'm here, rubbing my belly on my couch (thank god it's still here) and catching up on some fun youtube video from my subscribers, many of which specialize in the traveling sector, one of my favorite vloggers has posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C06Qmysp2Rk) of a break down due to her stress on the road. This made me realize some things to be aware of before I started my journey. Now I wasn't quite prepared for the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdAYqZ_fNew), which was strategically placed as a follow up video, in which the vlogger was years before where the topic was things you get sick of after traveling.

It was very interesting to see the after then before. All in all it was good. It was just a great way to frame the content in that order. I'm still looking forward to our journey. I certainly don't expect it will end after this trip. But I think this realization has certainly been helpful in preparing us for what lies ahead.
