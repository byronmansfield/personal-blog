So here is the part where I'm suppose to tell you guys who I am, and a little about myself. I'm really bad at these things, but here goes.

I was a DevOps Engineer in San Francisco who recently decided to travel the world. I am passionate about software development and Linux. Not sure how I ended up being a techie, I didn't really have a typical upbringing. I was raised by hippies and lived the first 5 years of my life without running water or electricity in a cabin in the woods of North Carolina. First few months of my life even called an old school bus our home.

Outside of what I did in my career and my life beginnings, I have also been a welder, plumber, brewer, piercer, and tons of other things in between. Guess I was just trying to figure out what I wanted to be.

Other than work, I really enjoy rock climbing and the outdoors. I am also an amateur photographer and inspiring musician. While I do play the drums and guitar, it's hard to play those while on the road. So since I'm fairly tech savvy I've recently started producing music in a DAW. Mostly EDM stuff.

Anyways, thanks for checking out my blog and getting to know me a little more. Feel free to shoot me an email.
